Install

To compile the source code you need:

1.  Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 or compatible
2.  The included source code for unformat.exe
3.  A PC running some form of DOS.  (Probably 
    equivalent to MS-DOS 4.1 or greater.)

Instructions:

Note:  I used Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 as a compiler, the instructions 
       will vary depending upon the compiler used.

1.  Run the GUI version of Borland Turbo C++ 3.0 by typing "tc"
2.  Go under "File" on the menu bar at the top of the screen and load 
    the source code.
3.  Go under "Compile" on the menu bar and select "Build all."
4.  Exit from the compiler and you will have the executable.
