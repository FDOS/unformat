Description:  Unformats quick-formatted hard disks.

Compiler:  Borland Turbo C++ 3.0  (Program is written in C)

Licensing:  Licensed under GNU GPL

Warranties:  This program has no warranties, either stated or implied.

Operating Systems known to work under:
	MS-DOS 6.22

Operating Systems known not to work under:
	Windows 95 (Windows 95's format command does not write a
	  mirror image as I previously thought.)

Future Plans:
	  1.  Add more functionality as per the spec on unformat.
	  2.  Add a warning before the program starts any drive activity
	      to warn the user of the possibly destructive nature of this
	      program if used on a drive that does not need unformatted.
	  3.  Fix any encountered bugs.
