HELP

This program restores a disk that has been formatted by using the MS-DOS command
  "format drive: /q"

This program is executed by the following syntax:

UNFORMAT drive: [/J]
UNFORMAT drive: [/U] [/L] [/TEST] [/P]
UNFORMAT /PARTN [/L]
UNFORMAT /?

where:

     drive:     Drive letter to unformat
     /J         Verifies that the mirror files are synchronized with the disk.
*    /U         Unformats without using the MIRROR files.
     /L         Lists all files and directories found, or, when used with the
		  /PARTN switch, displays current partition tables.
    /PARTN      Restores the partition tables saved by MIRROR /PARTN.
*   /TEST       Displays information, but does not write changes to disk.
*   /P          Sends output messages to LPT1.
    /?          Displays the help screen.
